Hi Verneri- 

Nice chatting with you today! As I mentioned, the tutorial covers pretty much everything to get started.
A couple things to point out.

-For the update function, you can add the argument local=True and download your file in /data and call it 'rs_file.txt.' The default streams our 1000 genomes file from a server. A sample rs_file is included in demo to show you the format. After running the update function with a trait file of interest, there may be a list of SNPs printed for which 1000 genomes data was not found (or your own provided data). In this case I reference dbSNP to manually add the alleles in with a text editor (probably the most non-ideal step in this version). 

For the filter function, the default is streaming an all metabolic p value file for which information is in the documentation. Again, you can download a local version from coruscant.itmat.upenn.edu/merp/ (it's v4), put in /data and rename to pval_file.txt. Then add argument localp=True (this is covered in docs). I think this file  would be a good starting point for confounding filtering, although which primary confounders we select, and wheter there are any other confounders we may add to the file we can discuss. 

Let me know if there are any obstacles or questions at any time and I'll try to get a response back ASAP.
