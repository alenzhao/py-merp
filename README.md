MeRP 1.0
========
MeRP is an open-source tool that streamlines the curation of genetic variants from NHGRI GWAS catalog, the filtering steps, and the causal effect-score calculation for Mendelian Randomization analysis.

Detailed documentation at [py-merp.github.io](http://py-merp.github.io)

NOTE: Abridged disease endpoint data and P-val file included in /data including SNPs from 7 published trait instrumental variable files (IVFs). Demo IVFs and results in /filtered_files and /analysis. For the complete disease endpoint data for CHD and T2D, unzip /data files. For local_p = True (for low bandwith), download from allmetabolic_pvals_v4.txt and 1000_genomes data from http://coruscant.itmat.upenn.edu/merp/ using wget.
